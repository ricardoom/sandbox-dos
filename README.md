# Sandbox Dos

This project serves as playground for designing and developing a theme

- Takes advantage of the Open Props project

- Incorporates a CUBE methodology for writing Sass and CSS

- In this case it uses git submodules to incorporate the theme.

  - Future version should stick to either git submodule or go modules. Maintaining two will be too much.
